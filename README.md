# Photos Search UI Demo

This repository contains an Xcode project demonstrating how to recreate the Search UI from Apple's new Photos app in iOS 18 using Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI.

This project relies on private UIKit APIs - namely `UIKBBackdropView`, the view responsible for rendering the background of Apple's internal `UIKeyboard`. Therefore, the code should be used for educational purposes only.
